Hi there! I am a PhD Fellow at the Cosmic DAWN Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen. I work on JWST observations to better understand the role of red galaxies in galaxy evolution with the guidance of Sune Toft and Gabe Brammer.

I recently completed a Master's in Astrophysics in June 2023 from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, supported by the Inlaks Scholarship. I did my master's thesis in the Cosmic Dawn Group at Geneva, titled "Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe from First JWST Observations", where I was supervised by Dr. Laia Barrufet and Prof. Pascal Oesch. Before this, I completed a Bachelor's in Physics and a Postgraduate Diploma from Ashoka University, India in 2020 and 2021.
