I recently completed a Master's in Astrophysics from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, supported by the Inlaks Scholarship. I did my master's thesis in the Cosmic Dawn Group at Geneva, titled "Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe from First JWST Observations", where I was supervised by Prof. Pascal Oesch and Dr. Laia Barrufet. Before this, I completed a Bachelor's in Physics and a Postgraduate Diploma from Ashoka University, India in 2020 and 2021.

At the beginning of 2024, I will be moving to the Cosmic Dawn Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen as a PhD Fellow to explore the dawn of galaxy quenching within the context of galaxy evolution.
