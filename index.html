   <p>I am a PhD Fellow at the <a href="https://cosmicdawn.dk/" target="_blank">Cosmic DAWN Center</a>, Niels Bohr Institute, 
      Copenhagen, working with Sune Toft and Gabe Brammer.
      I work on JWST observations to better understand the 
      role of red galaxies in galaxy evolution.<p>
  
   <p>I recently completed a Master's in Astrophysics in June 2023 from the University of Geneva,
      Switzerland, supported by the Inlaks Scholarship. I did my master's thesis in the 
      <a href="https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/cosmicdawn/" target="_blank">Galaxy Build-up at Cosmic Dawn</a> group
      at Geneva, titled "Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe from First JWST Observations", 
      where I was supervised by Dr. Laia Barrufet and Prof. Pascal Oesch. Previously, 
      I completed a Bachelor's in Physics and a Postgraduate Diploma from Ashoka University, India
      in 2020 and 2021.</p>
