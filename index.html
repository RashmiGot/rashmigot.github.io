<h1>Rashmi Gottumukkala</h1>
<p>I am a PhD Fellow at the <a href="https://cosmicdawn.dk/">Cosmic DAWN Center</a>, Niels Bohr Institute, 
    Copenhagen working with Sune Toft and Gabe Brammer.
    I work on JWST observations to better understand the 
    role of red galaxies in galaxy evolution.<p>

 <p>I recently completed a Master's in Astrophysics in June 2023 from the University of Geneva,
    Switzerland, supported by the Inlaks Scholarship. I did my master's thesis in the 
    <a href="https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/cosmicdawn/">Galaxy Build-up at Cosmic Dawn</a> group
    at Geneva, titled "Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe from First JWST Observations", 
    where I was supervised by Dr. Laia Barrufet and Prof. Pascal Oesch. Previously, 
    I completed a Bachelor's in Physics and a Postgraduate Diploma from Ashoka University, India
    in 2020 and 2021.</p>
