<h1>Rashmi Gottumukkala</h1>
<p>I am a PhD Fellow at the Cosmic DAWN Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen.
    I work on JWST observations to better understand the role of red galaxies in galaxy evolution
    with the guidance of Sune Toft and Gabe Brammer.<p>

 <p>I recently completed a Master's in Astrophysics in June 2023 from the University of Geneva,
    Switzerland, supported by the Inlaks Scholarship. I did my master's thesis in the Cosmic Dawn Group
    at Geneva, titled "Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe from First JWST Observations", 
    where I was supervised by Dr. Laia Barrufet and Prof. Pascal Oesch. Before this, 
    I completed a Bachelor's in Physics and a Postgraduate Diploma from Ashoka University, India
    in 2020 and 2021.</p>
